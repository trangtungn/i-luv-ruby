## BinaryGap

**Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.**

A binary gap within a positive integer `N` is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of `N`.

For example, number `9` has binary representation `1001` and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number `529` has binary representation `1000010001` and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number `20` has binary representation `10100` and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number `15` has binary representation `1111` and has no binary gaps. The number `32` has binary representation `100000` and has no binary gaps.

Write a function:

    def solution(n)

that, given a positive integer `N`, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if `N` doesn't contain a binary gap.

For example, given `N = 1041` the function should return 5, because `N` has binary representation `10000010001` and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given `N = 32` the function should return 0, because `N` has binary representation '`100000`' and thus no binary gaps.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  - `N` is an integer within the range `[1..2,147,483,647]`.

# Arrays

## CyclicRotation

**Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.**

An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).

The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.

Write a function:

class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

For example, given

    A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
    K = 3
the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:

    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
For another example, given

    A = [0, 0, 0]
    K = 1
the function should return [0, 0, 0]

Given

    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    K = 4
the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]

Assume that:

N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
